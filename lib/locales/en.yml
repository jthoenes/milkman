The page from Remember The Milk will list something like the following: 'No callback URL specified for this API key. Your frob value is YOUR_FROB'. Copy and paste that YOUR_FROB value below and press <enter>:\n\n"
      auth_token_message: "\n%{username}, you've successfully authorized Milkman with Remember The Milk. As you can see we've received your username and an authorization token. Both this auth token, your API key and shared secret should be saved for later use. You can either save them in a YAML file and load them in your application, include them in the Ruby script where you're using this gem or set them as environment variables. That's completely up to you.\n\nBoth the auth token, API key and shared secret are listed below. Save them using one of the methods above (or perhaps another solution) as you'll need all of them to use Milkman in your own project. Oh, and Remember... The Milk!\n\n\tapi_key:       %{api_key}\n\tshared_secret: %{shared_secret}\n\tauth_token:    %{auth_token}\n\n"
